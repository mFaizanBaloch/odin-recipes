    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This pudding recipe begins with heating milk until it simmers.
        A mixture of sugar, cornstarch, and salt is gradually added and
        cooked until thickened. Vanilla extract is stirred in before chilling
        the pudding until set.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, heat 2 cups of whole milk over
            medium heat until it just begins to simmer.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup
            granulated sugar, 1/4 cup cornstarch, and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk the dry mixture into the simmering
            milk. Stir constantly until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla
            extract until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the pudding into individual serving dishes. Let it cool
            at room temperature for about 15 minutes, then refrigerate
            for at least 2 hours until chilled and set.</li>
        <li>Serve the chilled pudding plain or with toppings
            of your choice, such as whipped cream, fruit, or chocolate shavings.</li>
    </ol>
