        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 tsp instan coffee</li>
        <li>1/4 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cream</li>
        <li>75g chocolate of choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps for cake</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat your oven to 350F (conventional) and prepare
            a 9" cake pan with parchment paper and butter / oil</li>
        <li>If making your own buttermilk, mix 1/2 cup milk with 1/2
            tablespoon vinegar, stir, and set aside</li>
        <li>Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and
            salt in a bowl. Sift the ingredients to make sure there are no lumps</li>
        <li>Break in the egg, and add the vegetable oil and buttermilk.
            Use a whisk to gently mix until the ingredients come together</li>
        <li>In a smaller bowl, mix boiling water with cocoa powder
            and instant coffee, and whisk until you get a shiny mix.
            This step blooms the cocoa powder and brings out its lovely
            chocolatey notes</li>
        <li>Add the bloomed cocoa powder mix to the cake batter,
            and gently fold until combined</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan</li>
        <li>Bake at 350F for about ~20-25 minutes until a
            toothpick inserted into the center comes out
            with moist crumbs attached</li>
        <li>Wait 10 minutes and then turn out the cake onto a wire rack</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Steps for ganache</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring the cream to a boil, and pour over the chopped
            chocolate. Cover and rest for 5 minutes to allow the chocolate
            to melt, then mix until you get a shiny ganache. Rest for
            another 5 minutes so the ganache thickens slightly</li>
        <li>Pour the ganache over your cake, and you're ready to dive in!</li>
    </ol>
