# odin-recipes
This repo is to showcase a basic HTML website, which was assigned as a project by "The Odin Project".

The website contains a landing page, and 3 hyperlinks, each displaying a recipe. The recipe pages consist of an image, description, ingredients, and steps required to complete the recipe.

Note: every implementation is as fundamental as it gets, only basic HTML tags were used.
